This ensures that your meal preferences are linked to your booking. If you don't have an account, you can easily create one by clicking on the 'Sign Up' button and following the instructions. Once logged in, navigate to the 'Manage Booking' section. Here, you will find an option to select or modify your in-flight meal preferences. This step is crucial as it verifies your identity and ensures that your meal selection is correctly associated with your flight details. Additionally, logging in allows you to access other personalized services and updates related to your flight, such as seat selection, baggage allowance, and special requests. It also helps the airline keep track of your preferences for future flights, making your travel experience more convenient and tailored to your needs."

This will take you to a detailed page of your flight itinerary. On this page, look for the 'Meal Preferences' or 'In-Flight Services' option. Selecting the correct flight ensures that your meal choice is accurately recorded for the specific journey you are taking. This step also allows you to review other details of your flight, such as departure and arrival times, layovers, and any special services you may have requested. By confirming the flight details, you can avoid any confusion or errors in your meal selection, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable travel experience."

Each meal option will have a description and sometimes a photo to help you make your choice. Select the meal that best suits your preferences and dietary needs. If you have any allergies or special requests, make sure to note them in the provided section. This step is important to ensure that your meal is prepared according to your preferences and requirements. Additionally, some airlines offer premium meal options for an extra fee, which you can choose if you want to enhance your in-flight dining experience.

Once you are satisfied with your choice, click on the 'Confirm' or 'Save' button. You may receive a confirmation email or notification on the website confirming your meal selection. It's a good idea to print or save this confirmation for your records. This step ensures that your meal choice is finalized and will be available during your flight. Additionally, some airlines allow you to make changes to your meal selection up to a certain time before your flight, so it's worth checking the policy in case you need to make any adjustments.
